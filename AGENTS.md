This file is a generated Codex-oriented projection of repo governance.
Edit the canonical sources instead of editing this file directly.

Canonical governance sources:
- `CLAUDE.md` — human-readable project rules, workflow, and references
- `scripts/relationships.yaml` — machine-readable ADR, coupling, and required-reading graph

## Purpose

AC14 uses `CLAUDE.md` as canonical repo governance and workflow policy.

## Commands

```bash
make test    # run test suite
make check   # typecheck + lint
```

## Operating Rules

This projection keeps the highest-signal rules in always-on Codex context.
For full project structure, detailed terminology, and any rule omitted here,
read `CLAUDE.md` directly.

### Principles

- Fail loud — no silent fallbacks
- Commit every verified slice
- Use `docs/plans/` for non-trivial work

### Workflow

Use `docs/plans/` for implementation plans. Run `make test` before committing.

## Machine-Readable Governance

`scripts/relationships.yaml` is the source of truth for machine-readable governance in this repo: ADR coupling, required-reading edges, and doc-code linkage. This generated file does not inline that graph; it records the canonical path and sync marker, then points operators and validators back to the source graph. Prefer deterministic validators over prompt-only memory when those scripts are available.
